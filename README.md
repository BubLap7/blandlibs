# Blandrice's Library

ðŸ“–â˜• Hi Friends, welcome to my library â˜•ðŸ“–

I made a quick script to do Krunkscript Library. I'm hoping it makes scripting easier for now

# How it Works
1. Including: 
    - C-style syntax is used : `#include <lib.krnk>`
2. Process: 
    - Search-Replace: will happen for libraries in the above `#include` path 
        - import happens once per library (cannot import library 2 times)
    - Global Variables and Actions: wil be prepended with library name
        - e.g. in `lib.krnk`, 
            - global var `num time` --> `num lib_time`
            - global action `num action myaction()` --> `num action lib_myaction()`
    - Recursion: Libraries can include other Libraries (again, cannot include more than once)
        - e.g. `lib.krnk` can have `#include <other_lib.krnk>`
            - be careful - the global variables will keep prepending (in above example: `num lib_other_lib_time`)

    - A library's **public actions** are automatically inserted/prepended, e.g.:
        
            public action start(){
                library_start(); # <-- automatically added 
                # your script's start code
                ...
            }
            
3. Invoking:
    
        python py/compile.py maps/testmap_client.krnk

    output will be printed in the `/out` folder

Here's some more details:


# Directory Structure
`/libs`: use/put your libraries here

`/maps`: Create your map scripts (client/server side) here

`/out`: final compiled output script here

Example Structure:

    \BLANDLIBS
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€libs # 1. all libraries referenced will be here
    â”‚   â”‚   raybox.krnk
    â”‚   â”‚
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€float16
    â”‚           float16.krnk
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€maps # 2. create your mapfile here (including libraries above)
    â”‚       testmap_client.krnk # calls raybox.krnk, float16.krnk
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€out # 4. compiled map file (put this into KrunkScript editor)
    â”‚       testmap_client.krnk
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€py # 3. python file to be called
    â”‚       compile.py
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€temp # scratch space for compile.py

# Example Library Import

    #include <raybox.krnk> 
    #include <float16.krnk>

# How to Invoke Library Compiler

    cd blandlibs
    python py/compile.py maps/testmap_client.krnk


# Notes
My parsing is not the best because this is just a quick job to get libs before Krunker actually implements them!

Watch out for these bad practices that may break my code:
- do NOT include brackets () in `# comments`
- do NOT MANUALLY include calls to update functions in other libraries in any script
    - My python script should handle that for you
- do NOT mess with the syntax of public action line too much
    - e.g. `public action update(num delta) {`
        - best just to keep it in one line like a normal person would
- I am not responsible for conflicting libraries e.g.:
    - sendNetworkMessage() limit exceeded
    - onPlayerUpdate player position/velocity conflicts

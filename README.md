# Blandrice's Library
<center>ðŸ“–â˜• Hi Friends, welcome to my library â˜•ðŸ“–</center>
<center>I made a quick script to do Krunkscript Library. I'm hoping it makes scripting easier for now!</center>

1.  C-style syntax is used : `#include <lib.krnk>`
2. Libraries insert only once 
    - (for those familiar with C, that means there is no need to guard using `#ifdef`)
3. A library's **public actions** are automatically inserted/prepended, e.g.:
    
        public action start(){
            library_start(); # <-- automatically added 
            # your script's start code
            ...
        }
        

Here's some more details:


# Directory Structure
`\libs`: use/put your libraries here

`\maps`: Create your map scripts (client/server side) here

Example Structure:

    \BLANDLIBS
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€libs # all libraries referenced will be here
    â”‚   â”‚   raybox.krnk
    â”‚   â”‚
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€float16
    â”‚           float16.krnk
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€maps # create your mapfile here (including libraries above)
    â”‚       testmap_client.krnk # calls raybox.krnk, float16.krnk
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€out # compiled map file (put this into KrunkScript editor)
    â”‚       testmap_client.krnk
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€py # python file to be called
    â”‚       compile.py
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€temp # scratch space for compile.py

# Example Library Import

    #include <raybox.krnk> 
    #include <float16.krnk>

# How to Invoke Library Compiler

    cd blandlibs
    python py/compile.py maps/testmap_client.krnk


# Notes
My parsing is not the best because this is just a quick job to get libs before Krunker actually implements them!

Watch out for these bad practices that may break my code:
- do not include brackets () in `# comments`
- do NOT MANUALLY include calls to update functions in other libraries in any script
    - My python script should handle that for you
- don't mess with the syntax of public action line too much
    - e.g. `public action update(num delta) {`
        - best just to keep it in one line like a normal person would
